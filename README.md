# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

I built a Tic-Tac-Toe game using ReactJS hooks. I hope you enjoy yourself playing my
Tic-Tac-Toe game.


## Getting Started 

There are two ways in which you can access the files in this repository. You can either clone the files with the git clone command or by downloading the zip file onto your computer. Once you've download the files, you need to acess the dependencies by running ```npm i``` on your command line.

## Running the app
Once your dependencies have been installed on the project, you can open the project by typing ```npm run start``` on your command line. The command will initialize the React application and run the server.


## Stopping the app

To close the server and the react appliction , you can either type ```command + z``` on the command or just exit the browser.

## Built With

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - The front-end framework used for this project

* [Netlify]() - The platform used to deploy the application.
